Let's have a simpler challenge for next week: let's write an anagram finder! That is, from a large list of words in for instance the English language, and a starting phrase, find all sequences of words that contain exactly the same letters in a different order.

For instance, given the phrase "Code club is great", the program will return, among other things, "Stoic cured bagel" or "Bored acetic slug".

Feel free to explore, for instance: optimizations, different languages or platforms, user interfaces, etc.
