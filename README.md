# A few small projects

Most notably:

- An anagram finder webtool written in Lua: https://castux.github.io/code-club/anagrams/
- A raycasting shader toy: https://castux.github.io/code-club/wave/
- A bit of fun with the Brainfuck language (including a small language that compiles to BF): https://github.com/Castux/code-club/tree/master/brainfuck
