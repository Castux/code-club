# Shader toys

Requirements:

- [Godot game engine](https://godotengine.org/) version 3.1

Shaders:

1. Mandelbrot fractal
2. Primality test and GCD computation
3. Experimenting with Godot's visual shader editor
4. Basic raymarching tests
5. Raymarching "realistic" demo. Quite heavy on the GPU.  Animation of the colors and position is done from script and with Godot's AnimationPlayer node. All the rest is procedural. Heavily inspired by [this](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/4sXGRM).

(Or check the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXT5JclvHt8) if it's too power hungry...)
