# Shader toys

Requirements:

- [Godot game engine](https://godotengine.org/) version 3.1

Shaders:

1. Mandelbrot fractal
2. Primality test and GCD computation
3. Experimenting with Godot's visual shader editor
4. Basic raymarching tests
5. Raymarching "realistic" demo. Quite heavy on the GPU. See [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXT5JclvHt8). Animation of the colors and position is done from script and with Godot's AnimationPlayer node. All the rest is procedural. Heavily inspired by [this](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/4sXGRM).
